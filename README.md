## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Load JSON Data**:
   - Paste JSON directly into the interface
   - Upload a JSON file
   - The viewer will automatically parse and display your data

2. **Navigate Your Data**:
   - Click the **ï¿½** arrows to expand/collapse sections
   - Use the search box to find specific content
   - Large arrays/objects are automatically collapsed for easier navigation

### Using the jq Query System

#### Method 1: Popular Queries (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Click the **=' Query Builder** button
2. Select the **Popular Queries** tab
3. Browse through 50+ common patterns like:
   - "Get property" - Extract specific fields
   - "Filter by value" - Find items matching criteria
   - "Sort by field" - Order results by any field
   - "Array operations" - First, last, slice operations
   - "String manipulation" - Split, replace, case conversion
4. Fill in the parameter fields (e.g., field names, values)
5. See the real-time query preview
6. Click **Use** to apply the query

#### Method 2: Step-by-Step Builder
1. Open the Query Builder and select **Step-by-Step**
2. Add operations one by one:
   - **Object Key** (.field) - Access object properties
   - **Array Index** (.[0]) - Get specific array elements
   - **Select** - Filter items by conditions
   - **Map** - Transform each item
   - **Sort/Group** - Organize results
3. Watch the query build in real-time
4. Save useful queries for later reuse

#### Method 3: Direct jq Input
1. Type jq queries directly in the search box
2. Examples:
   ```jq
   .users[0].name                    # Get first user's name
   .products | map(.price)           # Get all product prices
   .items[] | select(.status == "active")  # Filter active items
   ```

### Advanced Features

#### Saving & Reusing Queries
- In Step-by-Step mode, click **Save Query** to add to your library
- Access saved queries in the **Saved Queries** tab
- Queries persist between sessions using local storage
- Delete unwanted queries with the trash icon

#### Working with Large Files
- HugeJSON automatically optimizes display for large files
- Arrays/objects with 100+ items are collapsed by default
- Use targeted queries to extract specific data rather than expanding everything
- The search function works across the entire dataset efficiently

## Example Use Cases

### API Response Analysis
```jq
# Get all user emails from an API response
.data.users | map(.email)

# Find users in a specific city
.data.users[] | select(.address.city == "New York")
```

### Configuration File Processing
```jq
# Extract all database connection strings
.. | select(type == "object") | select(has("connectionString")) | .connectionString

# Find all enabled features
.features | to_entries | map(select(.value == true)) | map(.key)
```

### Data Transformation
```jq
# Transform user data for export
.users | map({
  id: .id,
  fullName: (.firstName + " " + .lastName),
  contact: .email
})
```

### Analytics & Reporting
```jq
# Calculate average order value
.orders | map(.total) | add / length

# Group sales by region
.sales | group_by(.region) | map({
  region: .[0].region,
  count: length,
  total: map(.amount) | add
})
```

## Popular Query Patterns

HugeJSON includes 50+ built-in query patterns covering:

### Basic Operations
- Identity, get keys/values, property access
- Array indexing, slicing, length
